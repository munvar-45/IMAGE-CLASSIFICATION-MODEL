#DESCRIPTION:
For Task 3 of CodTech Internship, I worked on building an Image Classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow.
I used the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 color images in 10 different classes like airplane, car, cat, dog, etc.
First, I normalized the data and then created a CNN model with 3 convolutional layers followed by dense layers. I used ReLU as the activation function and softmax in the final layer for multi-class output.

I trained the model for 10 epochs and evaluated it using test data. The model gave me around 70% accuracy, which is pretty good for a basic CNN.

Finally, I also plotted a graph to visualize how training and validation accuracy improved over time.

This task helped me understand how CNNs work, how to handle image data, and how to evaluate deep learning models. It was a great hands-on experience
What I Learned:
How to build CNN models from scratch using TensorFlow.

How to process and train image data.

The role of convolution, pooling, and dense layers in feature extraction and classification.

How to evaluate and visualize model performance using plots.

Improved my understanding of deep learning, especially in computer vision tasks.
This task gave me real exposure to how machines actually “see” images. It’s not just about feeding pictures — the model learns to recognize patterns like edges, shapes, and textures layer by layer. At first, I thought image classification was complicated, but building this CNN helped me break it down step by step. I also realized how tuning layers, activations, and epochs can directly affect performance. Even though I used a standard dataset, I now feel confident enough to try custom image classification in future projects. This task built my foundation in deep learning and computer vision.
